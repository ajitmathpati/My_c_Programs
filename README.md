# My First Program

Welcome to my repository! This is my first program written in C. Below is a brief description of the program.

## Description

This program is a simple demonstration of basic C programming concepts. It includes:

- Input and output operations
- Basic arithmetic operations
- A simple "Hello, World!" example

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/My_c_Programs.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd My_c_Programs
    ```
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):
    ```bash
    gcc -o my_program my_program.c
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```

## Example Output

```
Hello, World!
```
